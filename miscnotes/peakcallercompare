spp
+ finds anomalies and masks them out to ignore them 
+ compares peaks to whole genomes
+ + accuracy of detecting potential peaks depends on this
+ methods show calculation
+ subtract reads in same window
+ nonspecific size of data set determiens what's excluded.
+ library size weights normaliztion factor in what reads to remove

macs2
+ lambda value
+ + conservative comparison of entire background
+ collapses anomalies to 1
+ pileup is made w/ChipSEq coverage track
+ pileup is signal
+ looks at all input regions.
